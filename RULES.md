# Stage Blood
Draft 1.4, September 15, 2024

## Summary
The blood of the Theatre runs in your veins.
You and your opponents are theatrical agents, managing troupes of actors, who roam the countryside and perform the works of the era’s greatest playwrights.
For your troubles, you will earn the respect of six great households, and perhaps earn your reputation as the greatest company in the land!

* Players: 2 to 6
* Playing Time: 20-40 Minutes

## Components
* Deck of 54 Actors
* Deck of 32 Plays
* 72 favor tokens with a bag
* 24 Gold Coins
* These rules

## About Households
Six influential families are sponsors of the arts, and all the actors in your employ belong to one of these households.
The families are:

* Cooper (Gold Crowns)
* Fletcher (Black Swords)
* Hughes (Red Lions)
* Nash (Green Trees)
* Payne (Purple Grapes)
* Walker (Blue Fish)

You will score points and collect favors by casting actors in plays, hoping to gain influence with the six households by casting their members appropriately.
Favor with each household becomes victory points at the end of the game.
 
## Setting Up
Put all the favor tokens into the bag and mix them well.
Shuffle the deck of plays and set it aside.
Shuffle the deck of actors and deal a hand of five cards to each player.
Give each player one gold coin.

## Seasons
The game takes place over four seasons, each of which has several rounds.
In each round, players will select one actor from their hand, and those actors will be sent to work in the plays on the table.
Putting an actor to work can earn you favors, victory points, and coins.

## To Start Each Season
From the deck of plays, deal cards face up into the center of the table, until the total number of favor icons (see below) is equal to or higher than the following:

| Number of Players | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6+ |
|------------------ |----|----|----|----|----|
| Favors to Add     | 6  | 8  | 10 | 12 | 14 |

Next to each play, draw and place a number of favor tokens from the bag, equal to the number of icons on the card.

Example: A sample Tragedy with three Favor icons, a Theatrical Value of 15, and a point value of 3 would start with 3 favors.

1. Redraw: Except in the first season, players may now discard as many actors as they wish from their hands, and then draw back up to five cards.
Skip this step in the first season.
2. Each Round: To start each round, each player secretly chooses one actor from their hand.
These cards are revealed simultaneously.
They will then be assigned to plays in ascending order, as described below.
3. Each actor has a rank, between 1 and 9, and a suit, matching one of the six households.
For example, the card at right has a rank of 9, and belongs to the Green family (trees).

Lower-ranked actors will act first, as described below, with ties broken alphabetically.
This means that, between two actors of the same rank, first names that are earlier in the alphabet will go first.
 
## Acting
In ascending order of rank, actors will be sent to work on plays.
Here they might collect favors, complete the plays, or gain gold coins, as follows:

### Earning a Favor
If the suit of your actor matches the suit on one of the favors on that play (or part of it), you may collect one matching token.
Favors you collect represent good standing with that household, and may be worth points at the end of the game.

### Finishing a Play
If the rank of the actor, added to all the actors who are already working on the play, is equal to or greater than its theatrical value, then the play is finished, and you collect the play card.
Plays are worth victory points, and may also include additional favors, printed on the cards, as in the example above.

### Both
It is possible to satisfy both of the above conditions, matching a favor and finishing a play, in which case you get both: collect one favor as well as taking the play.

### Neither
If you send an actor to a play where they do not match any of the favors, and they do not finish the play, you gain neither of the bonuses above.
Instead, you earn a gold coin.
Note that you can’t take a gold coin by choice; you can earn it only if there is nothing else for that actor to take at that location.

## Rehearsing
Actors who did not complete their assigned plays will remain on the table, contributing their value to the work, until another actor comes along to finish it.
Once they are working on a play, actors give no further benefit to the players who sent them.
They will be discarded once the play is finished.

## Clearing the Board
Once a play is finished, discard all the actors who were working on it, and clear away any unclaimed favors from that location.
(But do not return them to the bag.)

## Gold Coins
You collect a gold coin each time your actor collects nothing else from the play, as described above, or if there is nowhere for your actor to go (this can sometimes happen at the end of a season).
Gold coins are worth one victory point.
When you send an actor to a play, you may spend gold coins to add 2 points each to the value of that actor.
This doesn’t change the actor’s speed, but it could make them large enough to complete the play.
You can spend multiple coins on the same actor if you wish.

## End of Round
The round ends after all actors have been assigned and all rewards have been collected.
If there are still two or more plays on the table, play another round.
If only one remains, or none, then the season is over.
The season also ends if the players run out of actors.

Leave any unfinished plays on the table, exactly as they are, and deal new plays to start the next round, counting only the value of the new cards.
 
## End of Game
The game ends after Season 4.
In this season, you continue until no plays remain.

### Scoring
Players score victory points by having the most favors, as well as second-most, for each of the six households.
You can also score in other ways, as described below.
Track your score on paper.
(Exception: In a two-player game, points are awarded only for first place.)

### Favors
For each household, count the total number of favors you have collected, including those found on plays.
In each of the six household colors,

* The player with the most favors scores 10 points,
* The player with the second-most scores 5 points, and
* Everyone else, and any player with no favors from that household, scores nothing.

### Ties
If two or more players are tied for first place, they divide 15 points as evenly as possible, rounding off any extra.
If two or more players are tied for second place, they divide 5 points.

### Two-Player Scoring
With two players, award only 5 points for first place, and nothing for second place.

### Bonus Points
In addition to the above, you can score additional points as follows:

* Set Bonuses: For each set of three plays including one play of each type (Comedy, Tragedy, and History), score 5 points.
* Card Values: Each play has a point value in the lower right.
* Gold Coins: Unspent gold coins are worth 1 point each.

## Tracking Scores
You can keep score on paper, or you can use the actor cards, since all of these are discarded at the end of the game.
Use facedown actor cards as 1 point each, and faceup cards as 5 points each, regardless of their rank.
This can be quicker than using paper.
